##1 Introduction

We will be producing a command line Java application named "AverageSentenceLength" that will take a txt file as input and will return/print a calcualation the average number of words per sentence.  A flag of -d will allow the user to specify the punctuation of a sentence.  The flag -l will allow the user to specify the minimum word length to count.

##2 User Requirements

###2.1 Software Interface
The application will work with the command line interface with java 1.6+ installed.   

###2.2 User Interfaces
The user will enter java AverageSentenceLegnth <text-file-location> into the command line while in the same directory as the jar file.

An optional flag can be used to specify the punctuation that marks the end of a sentence with -d "puctiation"

An optional flag can be used to specify the minimum word length to count with -l "length"

The output will be the average words per sentence rounded down to the closest integer.
 
For invalid inputs a collection of helpful messages will be produced to help guide the user to use the software correctly

###2.3 User Characteristics
There will be approximately 350 students per term that will be encouraged to use this software.  They will have range from having no/novice computer skills to thoso that can expert level users who can also program. 
 
###2.4 Assumptions and Dependencies
We assume users are familiar with a command line interface 
We assume users know how access the command line interface
We assume users can navigate the directory structure of the command line interface
We assume the users have java 1.6 installed
